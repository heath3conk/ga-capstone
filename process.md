To do:
- [] run classification models on "food.csv"
- [] join "content.csv" to "food.csv" by "food_id" - looking to add the "food_group" column to content.csv data
- [] take the best one (or maybe two) models & run them on the joined data
- [] figure out what chemical/nutrient data I can get for each ingredient - check out the other tables from foodb and the flavordb website, maybe try the [foodb api](https://foodb.ca/api_doc)
- [] plot the flavor/nutrient profile of the recipe, using the weight of the ingredients
- [] error handling: how to handle ingredients in recipe that I can't find in the db
- [] build app
