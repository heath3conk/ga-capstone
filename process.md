To do:
- [] run classification models on "food.csv"
- [] join "content.csv" to "food.csv" by "food_id" - looking to add the "food_group" column to content.csv data
- [] take the best one (or maybe two) models & run them on the joined data
- [] look for adjectives in description, maybe a parts-of-speech model? or make a list to create flag columns as features?
- [] look at [multiclassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier.html#sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier)
- [] recommender system: calculate similarities between all the foods
- [] figure out what chemical/nutrient data I can get for each ingredient - check out the other tables from foodb and the flavordb website, maybe try the [foodb api](https://foodb.ca/api_doc)
- [] plot the flavor/nutrient profile of the recipe, using the weight of the ingredients
- [] error handling: how to handle ingredients in recipe that I can't find in the db
- [] build app
