To do:
- [x] run classification models on "food.csv"
- [x] join "content.csv" to "food.csv" by "food_id" - looking to add the "food_group" column to content.csv data
- [x] take the best one (or maybe two) models & run them on the joined data 
        - logistric regression took about an hour to train on colab on the large data set
        - knn ran for 17+ hours and then failed
- [x] look for adjectives in description, maybe a parts-of-speech model? or make a list to create flag columns as features?
- [x] change data source & entire plan (yay!)
- [x] explore recipes, raw & encoded
- [x] build "flagged" recipes from recipe data -> dummifies pre-processed recipe data based on "ingredient_ids"
- [x] run kmeans on flagged data & calculate silhouette score (it's not great)
- [x] fetch a recipe from API & get a cluster prediction from the model (even if it's not great yet)
- [x] encode that process in py file
- [x] set up model trials (may need to run overnight?)
        - kmeans
        - dbscan
- [x] filter recipes & run the models on dinner/main course recipes alone
- [x] try filtering dummified data to use only the most frequent ingredients
        - arbitrary filtering
        - PCA
- [x] try hierarchical clustering
        - agglomerative clustering
        - BIRCH
- [] try filtering by cuisine
- [] try different tokenizers, word2vec, tfidf, roBERTa
- [x] calculate cosine similarity between the recipes, check out word2vec & recommender lectures
- [x] refine model to predict ingredients
- [x] build app MVP - almost there
- [x] error handling: how to handle ingredients in recipe that I can't find in the db
- [] future work: look into association rule mining
- [] update resume with details on capstone & project 5
